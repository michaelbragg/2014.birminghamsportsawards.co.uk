            <p>Inspirational Magazine is delighted to be involved with the Birmingham Sports Awards.  We are dedicated to finding the very best that the West Midlands has to offer and these awards are another perfect opportunity to do so.  The region is so diverse and there are so many examples of true sporting excellence, both professional and amateur, that we see it time and again in teams, individuals and, of course, in all those people who work so hard behind the scenes.</p>
            <p>Our sponsorship of the Amateur Sportswoman of the Year Award is driven by our desire to recognise the success of those in the West Midlands who compete solely for the love of their chosen sport. Often that is reward enough for amateur sportspeople but we think it important that we do our bit to support their efforts and celebrate their achievements.</p>
