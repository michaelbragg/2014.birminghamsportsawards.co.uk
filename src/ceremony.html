<p><a class="outbound link" href="http://www.cureleukaemia.co.uk/"><img class="image__responsive" src="{{ site.media }}/logo/logo_cure-leukaemia.png" alt="Cure Leukaemia - The blood cancer charity" style="float: right"></a>The night will raise money for Cure Leukaemia and the Steve Staunton foundation. Cure Leukaemia helps to bring pioneering drug and transplant treatments to blood cancer patients in the Midlands. The charity part-finances the world-class Centre for Clinical Hematology at QE Hospital Birmingham, to fund life-saving clinical trials to treat terminally ill leukemia patients. To date Cure Leukemia has helped to treat thousands of patients through leveraging nearly £21m worth of revolutionary drugs and funding crucial research nurses to administer these trials. Through a small game and silent auction which will take place throughout the evening, we plan to raise much needed funds for this truly worthwhile cause.</p>
