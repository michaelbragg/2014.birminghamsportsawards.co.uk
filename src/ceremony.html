Cure Leukaemia helps to bring pioneering drug and transplant treatments to blood cancer patients in the Midlands. The charity part-finances the world-class Centre for Clinical Hematology at QE Hospital Birmingham, to fund life-saving clinical trials to treat terminally ill leukemia patients. To date Cure Leukaemia has helped to treat thousands of patients through leveraging nearly &pound;21m worth of revolutionary drugs and funding crucial research nurses to administer these trials. Through a small game and silent auction which will take place throughout the evening, we plan to raise much needed funds for this truly worthwhile cause.</p>

<p><!--<a class="outbound link" href="http://www.cureleukaemia.co.uk/">--><img class="image__responsive" src="{{ site.media }}/logo/logo_the-stephen-staunton-foundation.png" alt="The Stephen Stauton Foundation" style="float: right"><!--</a>-->The Steve Staunton Foundation was established by the former Aston Villa, Liverpool and Republic of Ireland footballer and raises much-needed funds for a variety of charitable causes. The organisation&rsquo;s first Charity Ball raised money for Cystic Fibrosis and St Giles Hospice Walsall and was followed by a charity golfing event in Marbella that raised funds for Children with Cancer. The second annual Charity Ball raised money for the Norman Laud Association and Guide Dogs for the Blind. Steve Staunton is committed to raising funds for local charities and works hard to give something back to the local area he has lived in for nearly 20 years.</p>
